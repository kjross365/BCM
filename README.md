# BCM
Code for weather balloon flight computer. Any changes to the code should be made to a pull request. Also the name stands for "Balloon Computer Module" and I'm open to ideas. Just remember Hoevel needs to see this so it can't be like CUMGOBBLER 2.0. <br><br>
The overall idea for the code is to start by creating a new, empty, data.txt file. It will be formatted like:<br>

<br>
***//BCM\\***<br>
Time|ALtitude|Temperature|Pressure|Etc.<br>
0.0|   10    |    42.2   |  2.56  |Etc.<br>
5.0|   20    |    40.3   |  2.32  |Etc.<br>

<br>

This will continue to log for the rest of the flight for 5 seconds
